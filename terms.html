                    <h4>13. Dispute Resolution</h4>
                    <p>Before filing any claim against PlateOnRepeat, you agree to attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at legal@plateonrepeat.com. If we cannot resolve the dispute within 60 days, you agree to resolve any claims through binding arbitration rather than in court, except for small claims court claims. Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California.</p>

                    <h4>14. Class Action Waiver</h4>
                    <p>You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the dispute between us individually. There shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated or litigated on a class action basis or through any form of representative action. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration, and unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims.</p>

                    <p>We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time at our sole discretion. If we make material changes, we will provide notice through our Service or by other means to give you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. Your continued use of the Service after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the Service.</p>

                    <h4>16. Entire Agreement</h4>
                    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and PlateOnRepeat regarding the Service and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Service. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>
